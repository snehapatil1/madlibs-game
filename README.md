# madlibs-game
Madlibs game is where you enter certain random adjectives, nouns, verbs, famous characters, etc and that gets substituted in a paragraph making it less meaningful and more funny.

Interesting, isn't it?

This game is built in Python.

You can simply clone this repository and run madlibs.py file on console and you are ready to play the game.
